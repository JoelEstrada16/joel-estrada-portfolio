## Description
 I found this assignment to be pretty challenging, I think i just need to spend more time on media query's and finding out how to really use the padding and border elements in css. Regardless this assignment was really fun to do and before I start actually putting my next projects in ima fix it up better for when the time comes.

 ## Usage
  Top links you will fidn will bring you to each topic on the page except for the resume I gotaa build one for that one and each picture has a link attached to it as well for future projects to come.
